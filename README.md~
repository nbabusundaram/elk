Setting-up ELK (Elastic Search , Logstash  and Kibana) cluster in your Server/Laptop/VM/Whereever docker runs...


# Prerequisites

Docker should be installed in your system

You should have admin rights / root access to run the containers

Run the elk cluster in your laptop. I have created the shell script for easy installation. This script will download three images from the docker repository and run those images as a elk cluster.

 
# Instructions

1. Download the Scripts folder in your preferable directory.

2. Please place the elk-config folder in your home directory. It is very important, otherwise you have to change the elkstart.sh file according to the logstash configuration file location.

4. Now you supposed to get the running containers id as the response. If any error, please mail me nbabu.sundaram@gmail.com , i will happy to help you.

5. That's all. Everything set. Open the browser, and type http://localhost:9292. Now, you should able see the kibana dashboard.

6. If you want to tear-down the cluster, run the following command from the scripts folder Scripts# sh elkdown.sh
